# SYNCORE Cognitive OS — Public Whitepaper v1.0

This repository contains the public draft of **SYNCORE**, a proposed Cognitive Operating System architecture designed for the next era of AI.

SYNCORE introduces:
- Intent interpretation as the core abstraction
- A seven-layer world-model architecture
- TRAINBED: modular, ordered memory scaffolding
- GAIP: generative autonomous interaction protocol
- The North Star Protocol for multi-agent orchestration
- Blockchain-backed identity & self-verification
- Applications across industrial, embodied, and national-scale systems

This work synthesizes early cognitive architectures (NASA Remote Agent, SOAR, ACT-R, DARPA CALO) with modern foundation models, creating a blueprint for coherent, autonomous, consequence-driven AI.
